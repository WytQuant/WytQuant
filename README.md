#### This is Wittawas

I am a hardworking and highly motivated self-learning. Currently, I am also interested not only in software
technology such as web technology but also in blockchain technology, especially smart contracts, decentralized finance.
I believe strongly that blockchain technologies will become infrastructure in other platforms in the future. Therefore, my
goal is a part of people who use those tools to enhance our world.
